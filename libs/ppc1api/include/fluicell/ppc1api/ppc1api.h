	/**  \brief Simple API for the communication with the Fluicell PPC1 controller
	*
	*  The PPC1 controller is ...
	*
	*
	*
	*
	*  IMPORTANT: for the definition of all the constants, parameters and bit-conversion
	*             please refer to the documents:
	*                    CommandsetManualForFluicell.pdf
	*                    FluicellDeviceManager.pdf
	*
	*  Default parameters: Serial port baud rate 115200, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity
    *  NB! All commands must end with a newline character \n
	*
	*  Pressure setting commands. Argument %f - pressure in mbar as floating point number. Vacuum channels expects the
    *  argument with minus sign. \n
    *    - "A%f\n" set vacuum on channel A
    *    - "B%f\n" set vacuum on channel B
    *    - "C%f\n" set pressure on channel C
    *    - "D%f\n" set pressure on channel D
    *  Example: Vacuum on channel A "A-223.4\n" or pressure on C "C402.7\n"
	*
	*
	*  Valve opening or closing commands. Argument "%u" means 1 closed, 0 opened \n
    *    - "l%u\n" set valve state on channel A (Do not use in closed loop (automatic) mode)
    *    - "k%u\n" set valve state on channel B (Do not use in closed loop (automatic) mode)
    *    - "j%u\n" set valve state on channel C (Do not use in closed loop (automatic) mode)
    *    - "i%u\n" set valve state on channel D (Do not use in closed loop (automatic) mode)
	*
	*
	*  "u%u\n" sets serial data stream period. Argument "%u" is unsigned integer marking the time period in ms. Zero turns the data
    *  stream off. (This is useful in order to catch the output of ? # or ~ commands in the terminal window) Default data stream
    *  period is 100ms, and the minimum is 25ms.\n
    *  Example "u200\n" sets the data stream period to 200ms
	*
	*
	*  "o%u\n" sets the TTL output state where %u is either 1 or 0 (high or low)
	*
    *  Besides setting the state of the output with "o1\n" or "o0\n" one can generate pulses to the TTL output.
	* 
	*  "p%u\n" generates a pulse with a length of %u milliseconds. For example p30\n generates a 30 milliseconds long pulse. The
    *  initial state of the output is dependent of the previous "o%u" commands (default low). If the state of output before the
    *  pulse command is high, the pulse command puts the output low for the specified amount of time. The minimum pulse
    *  length is 20 milliseconds. \n
    *  "*\n" Gets the temperature of the micro-controller in degrees of Celsius. Not very accurate.
    *  "!\n" Reboots the device
