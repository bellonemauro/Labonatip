# Fetching instructions:

From git shell write:

    git clone https://___ your_folder

then you should get something like:

    Cloning into 'your_folder'...
    Username for 'https://github.com/': your_username 
    Password for '  your_username  ':    your_password  
    remote: Counting objects: 45, done.
    remote: Compressing objects: 100% (41/41), done.
    remote: Total 45 (delta 13), reused 0 (delta 0)
    Unpacking objects: 100% (45/45), done.
    Checking connectivity... done.

done !!!

# Building Instructions:

Use CMake to generate the solution for your system, see http://www.cmake.org

It is advised to set your build folder OUT of the source code folder, the build should be independent from the code. 

<b> Windows </b><br>
in the case you don't have environmental variables set you should find manually some dependences:
" \__\" folder 

in my experience everything is automatically found 

configure --->  generate and open visual studio

to build the package in windows : windeployqt yourfile.exe

<b> Linux </b>

CMake --> configure --> generate 

TODO
