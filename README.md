# Building Instructions:

Use CMake to generate the solution for your system, see http://www.cmake.org

It is advised to set your build folder OUT of the source code folder, the build should be independent from the code. 

<b> Windows </b><br>
in the case you don't have environmental variables set you should find manually some dependences:
" \__\" folder 

in my experience everything is automatically found 

configure --->  generate and open visual studio

to build the package in windows : windeployqt yourfile.exe

<b> Linux </b>

CMake --> configure --> generate
