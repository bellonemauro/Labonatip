# Building Instructions:

IMPORTANT: set your build folder OUT of the code folder,  
           the build must be independent from the code 

Use CMake to generate the solution for your system, see http://www.cmake.org

in the case you don't have environmental variables set you should find manually some dependences:
" \__\" folder 

in my experience everything is automatically found 

configure --->  generate and open visual studio

to build the package in windows : windeployqt yourfile.exe
