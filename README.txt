# Fetching instructions:

From git shell write:

    git clone https://___ your_folder

then you should get something like:

    Cloning into 'your_folder'...
    Username for 'https://bitbucket.org': your_username 
    Password for 'https://bellonemauro@gmail.com@bitbucket.org':    your_password

# Building Instructions:

IMPORTANT: set your build folder OUT of the code folder,  
           the build must be independent from the code 

Use CMake to generate the solution for your system, see http://www.cmake.org

in the case you don't have environmental variables set you should find manually some dependences:
" \__\" folder 

in my experience everything is automatically found 

configure --->  generate and open visual studio

to build the package in windows : windeployqt yourfile.exe
